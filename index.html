                    The 15 puzzle (also called Gem Puzzle, Boss Puzzle, Game of Fifteen, Mystic Square and many others) is a sliding puzzle having 15 square tiles numbered 1–15 in a frame that is 4 tiles high and 4 tiles wide, leaving one unoccupied tile position. Tiles in the same row or column of the open position can be moved by sliding them horizontally or vertically, respectively. The goal of the puzzle is to place the tiles in numerical order.

Named for the number of tiles in the frame, the 15 puzzle may also be called a 16 puzzle, alluding to its total tile capacity. Similar names are used for different sized variants of the 15 puzzle, such as the 8 puzzle that has 8 tiles in a 3×3 frame.

                    How to play "fifteen"?

After the “tags” are shuffled randomly, you can start the game. To move the "stone" from the "tags" to an empty cell, you need to "click" on it with the mouse. You can move in this way only the “stone”, which is located to the left / right or top / bottom of an empty cell. The goal of the game of fifteen is to collect all the numbers in order from 1 to 15 in this way, as quickly as possible and in the least number of moves.
